      <description>A fast C++ header-only library to help you quickly write parallel programs with complex task dependencies
The Era of Parallel Computing The evolution of computer architectures is moving toward multicore designs. It is common to find multiprocessor systems in today&amp;rsquo;s electronic products such as mobiles, laptops, desktops, and servers. In order to keep up with the performance scaling, it is becoming necessary for software developers to write parallel programs that utilize the number of available cores.</description>

      <description>A general-purpose distributed programming system using data-parallel streams.
New Distributed Programming Model DtCraft offers a new powerful programming model called stream graph to streamline the creation of distributed workloads. Users can focus on high-level developments using our models, leaving difficult concurrency details such as workload distribution and process communication to our system kernel.
There are myriads of cluster computing frameworks such as Hadoop MapReduce, Apache Spark, Dryad, and Ray. Each has its reason to exist.</description>

      <description>A High-Performance Static Timing Analysis Tool for VLSI Systems
Static Timing Analysis Static timing analysis (STA) is an important step in the over chip design flow. It verifies the expected timing characteristics of a circuit and ensures the chip can provide correct function after tape-out.
A practical timer has to interact with other tools that often call the timer thousand times in an inner loop. This raises many computational challenges, such as incremental timing, parallelization, scalability, and pessimism reduction.</description>
