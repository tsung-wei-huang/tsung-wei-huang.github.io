As a result, the recent EDA industry is driving the need for distributed computing to leverage large-scale compute-intensive problems, in particular, power grid analysis. In this paper, we introduce a distributed power grid analysis framework based on the stream graph model. We show that the stream graph model has better programmability over the MPI and enables flexible domain decomposition without limited by hardware resource. In addition, we design an efficient scheduling policy for this particular workload to maximize the cluster utilization to improve the performance. The experimental results demonstrated the promising performance of our framework that scales from single multi-core machines to a distributed computer cluster.","tags":["distributed-programming","power-grid-simulation"],"title":"A Distributed Power Grid Analysis Framework from Sequential Stream Graph","type":"publication"},{"authors":["C.-X.

By modern, we mean C++17, which has revolutionized the “old-fashion” C++98 in many aspects such as meta-programming, concurrency controls, and functional programming. Despite the tremendous progress in language innovation, research on how these advanced features can improve EDA programs is still nascent. In this paper, we introduce a novel routing framework using the technique of generalized constant expression in C++17. Our framework allows a router to take advantage of compile-time computation and thus can save a significant amount of engineering effort that would otherwise be issued every time the program runs. By prescribing computation at compile time, the compiler is able to further produce more optimized codes to run faster than ever before. We have evaluated our framework on classic routing problems and have demonstrated promising performance gain over which is done solely at runtime. Our framework has the potential to change many fundamental EDA building blocks and thus can achieve better tool performance and engineering productivity.","tags":["cpp","meta-programming"],"title":"Routing at Compile Time","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.-W.

Few researches so far discuss an efficient utilization of search knowledge in incremental fashion, which could dramatically speed up the search. Unfortunately, existing algorithms nearly rely on irregular and highly divergent search space, imposing acceleration challenges on refitting them to incremental version. Consequently, in this paper we present UI-Route, an ultra-fast incremental maze routing algorithm in grid environment. UI-Route is unique in breaking route equivalence, proving that a huge amount of equivalent search efforts can be optimally and incrementally eliminated. Equivalence breaking enables regularized search space, delivering well-tabulated search knowledge through the incremental processing.

However, the reliability problem is an imperative issue to guarantee the valid function of DMFBs. The reliability of DMFBs decreases when electrodes are excessively actuated, preventing droplets on DMFBs controlled successfully. Because the placement for bio-assays in DMFBs is a key step in generating corresponding actuating signals, the reliability of DMFBs must be considered during biochip placement to avoid excessive actuation. Although researchers have proposed several DMFB placement algorithms, they have failed to consider the reliability issue. In addition, previous algorithms were all based on the simulated-annealing (SA) method, which is time consuming and does not guarantee to obtain an optimal solution. This paper proposes the first reliability-oriented non-SA placement algorithm for DMFBs. This approach considers the reliability problem during placement, and uses the 3-D deferred decision making (3D-DDM) technique to enumerate only possible placement solutions. Large-scale DMFB placement can be synthesized efficiently by partitioning the operation sequential graph of bioassays. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed technique can achieve reliability-oriented placement for DMFBs without excessive actuation in each electrode, while optimizing bioassay completion time.","tags":["digital-microfluidic-biochip","ewod-chip","placement"],"title":"A Reliability-Oriented Placement Algorithm for Reconfigurable Digital Microfluidic Biochips Using 3-D Deferred Decision Making Technique","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.W.

Current CAD tools generally conduct a two-stage based design flow of fluidic-level synthesis followed by chip-level design to optimize fluidic behaviors and chip architecture separately. Nevertheless, existing fluidic-chip design gap will become even wider with a rapid escalation in the number of assay operations incorporated into a single DMFB.

Current CAD tools generally conduct a two-stage based design flow of fluidic-level synthesis followed by chip-level design to optimize fluidic behaviors and chip architecture separately. Nevertheless, existing fluidic-chip design gap will become even wider with a rapid escalation in the number of assay operations incorporated into a single DMFB. As more and more large-scale assay protocols are delivered in current emerging marketplace, this problem may potentially restrict the effectiveness and feasibility of the entire DMFB realization and thus needs to be solved quickly. In this paper, we propose the first fluidic-chip co-design methodology for DMFBs to effectively bridge the fluidic-chip design gap. Our work provides a comprehensive integration throughout fluidic-operation scheduling, chip layout generation, control pin assignment, and wiring solution to achieve higher design performance and feasibility.

Moreover, EWOD-chip designs might incur several obstacles in the routing region due to embedded devices for specific fluidic protocols. However, no existing works consider the EWOD-chip routing with obstacles. To remedy this insufficiency, we propose in this paper the first obstacle-avoiding routing algorithm for pin-constrained EWOD chips. Our algorithm, based on effective integer-linear-programming (ILP) formulation as well as efficient routing framework, can achieve high routability with a low design complexity.

By providing the droplet-based system, DMFB can perform real-time biological analysis and safety-critical biomedical applications. However, different droplets being transported and manipulated on the DMFB may introduce the contamination problem caused by liquid residue between different biomolecules. To overcome this problem, a wash droplet is introduced to clean the contaminations on the surface of the microfluidic array. However, current scheduling of wash droplet does not restrict the extra used cells and execution time of bioassay, thereby degrading the reliability and fault-tolerance significantly. In this paper, we propose a contamination aware droplet routing algorithm for DMFBs. To reduce the routing complexity and the used cells, we first construct preferred routing tracks by analyzing the global moving vector of droplets to guide the droplet routing. To cope with contaminations within one subproblem, we first apply a k -shortest path routing technique to minimize the contaminated spots. Then, to take advantage of multiple wash droplets, we adopt a minimum cost circulation (MCC) algorithm for optimal wash-droplet routing to simultaneously minimize used cells and the cleaning time. Since the droplet routing problem consists of several subproblems, a look-ahead prediction technique is further used to determine the contaminations between successive subproblems. After that, we can simultaneously clean both contaminations within one subproblem and those between successive subproblems by using the MCC-based algorithm to reduce the execution time and the used cells significantly.

In this paper, we propose a fast routability- and performance-driven droplet router for DMFBs. The main contributions of our work are: (1) a global moving vector analysis for constructing preferred routing tracks to minimize the number of used unit cells; (2) an entropy-based equation to determine the routing order of droplets for better routability; (3) a routing compaction technique by dynamic programming to minimize the latest arrival time of droplets.
